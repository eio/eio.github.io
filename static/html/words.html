		Watch from above as the forest feeds the heavens -
		<br>
		scattered bursts of vapor like distant smoke signals - 
		<br>
		evoking a memory of tonight’s impending embers 
		<br>
		giving life to ashen tongues through warm exhalations. 
		<br>
		______ (can you remember the future?) 
		<br>
		Tendrils of steam and pure curiosity are spirited through the air, 
		<br>
		ink swirls guided by delicate fingers: 
		<br>
		______ (a galaxy) 
		<br>
		Meandering yet full of purpose. 
		<br>
		Focus on this moment. Here. Now. 
		<br>
		______ (where do you go?) 
		<br>
		Mirror the eager roots beneath, merge with a river in the pregnant sky.
		See the rebirth of these ribbon-shaped sylphs 
		coalescing into raindrops for reunion underground. 
		A living network just out of reach. 
		Forces and feels of the constant fire. 
		Mycelium mind. The web’s pulsations. Glowing in anticipation. 
		Arms intertwined and open wide to welcome - 
		Oh dear child, where you have been! 
		Oh dear water, weary traveler, have you not heard 
		the whispers on the wind?

					______ (“you can not be all things to all people") 
					<br>
					Water smiles mouthlessly in response. 
					<br>
					Glistens like an eye that recalls what I forgot.
					<br> 
					Cryptic hierophant. Mystagogue of the mist. 
					<br>
					______ (the dew is sparkling with laughter now) 
					<br>
					At home in the dirt or the æther and firmament. 
					<br>
					At home in our limbs stretching somewhere between. 
					<br>
					Clouds are ancient rivers returning 
					<br>
					to the mountains with the wisdom of the sea. 
					<br>
					Dreams of great bodies of water mean change. 
					<br>
					Lucid visions of metempsychosis. 
					<br>
					Nature’s glossolalia speaks mystery through the trees. 
					<br>
					Wizard with a wand. The lightning. The Light. 
					<br>
					I blink and we are transformed 
					<br>
					______ (again)
